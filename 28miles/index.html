        <h1> 28 for 28 </h1>

        <p class="text"> I have always loved walking. Since I don't have a car, and I live in such 
        a blessedly walkable area, I pretty much walk everywhere and can rack up the 
        miles quickly. But I don't typically walk for sustained long distances - usually 
        it'll be a mile or two here, a mile or two there, adding up over the course of 
        a day. </p>

        <p> This fall I did two long-ish day hikes in Harpers Ferry, WV with my mom, 
        and I felt <i>great</i>. It reminded me how much I love to plod on, and it made 
        me start to wonder what my limits were in terms of walking. I've always wanted 
        to do a lengthy walk in the Greater Boston area (like Somerville to Walden Pond) 
        and cooked up this idea to try and walk 28 miles on my 28th birthday. </p>

        <p> It's over a marathon, and I haven't been training for it like it's a marathon, 
        so maybe this is really stupid. But I want to at least try! I'm also trying to 
        raise some money for Boston Food Not Bombs and for the Shamia family in Gaza.</p>

        <h2> Plan </h2>

        <p> My plan is to do this walk the day of my birthday - the 24th. If the weather is bad on my
        birthday, I'll do the walk on the 26th. I'm going to start walking fairly early 
        (right before sunrise) and hope to be done by the early evening. </p>

        <p> My route is still in the works, but in order to make it easy to take breaks 
        and use the bathroom, I'll probably start on the <a href="http://minutemanbikeway.org/">Minuteman Trail</a> and split off to 
        the <a href="https://www.baycircuit.org/maps-guides/"> Bay Circuit Trail</a> in 
        Bedford. I'm also tempted to do a "city walk" but I think that will take substantially 
        longer, as I'll have to stop at crosswalks. I'll be tracking my route/miles via 
        Strava on the day of the walk. </p>

        <h2> Support me! </h2>
        <p> There are two ways to support me: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Sign up to keep me company on my walk
            <li> Donate or pledge
        </ul>
        <h3> Keep me company on my walk </h3>
        <p> You can sign up at the Calendly link below to keep me company on my walk. 
        This can be via phone call, or for walking with me for a portion of it! You can
        also text me and I'll coordinate. It'll be fun, I hope, and you'll help me avoid 
        perhaps too many hours of Meditative Walking.</p>

        <h3> Donate or pledge </h3>
        <p> I'm raising money for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bostonfoodnotbombs">
        Boston Food Not Bombs</a> and <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/my-appeal-to-rebuild-my-house-in-gaza">
        the Shamia family in Gaza</a>. If you're interested in donating/pledging, you 
        can donate to either group. I'll match any donations to the Shamia family GoFundMe, 
        just send me a screenshot of your donation. </p>
        <p> If you want to pledge instead of donating a flat amount, that would also be 
        awesome. There's a decent chance I don't hit 28 miles, but knowing I'd be raising 
        more money to support a family enduring a genocide or to fund local 
        mutual aid efforts would be a big motivator. </p>
        <p> For Food Not Bombs, you can Venmo <b>@surreality1</b> or contribute to 
        <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/food-not-bombs-funds">our GoFundMe</a>.</p>
        <p> In continuing with the "28" theme, it'd be cool to raise 280 dollars total! </p>
